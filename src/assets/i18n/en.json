  "ABOUT_ME_DESCRIPTION": "I have a strong interest in both web and mobile technologies. I love to analyze various web applications, find meaningful insights, develop a prototype, and show the outcome through a web application. I have over two years of experience as a full stack developer and lecturer at Prime University, where I built and taught web technologies using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>. Due to my passion for web technologies, I have developed some knowledge in both frontend and backend development. I have good knowledge of frontend frameworks and libraries such as <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>Redux</strong>. I also have experience in backend development with <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>RESTful API</strong>. I am well-versed with test automation tools like <strong>Jest</strong> and am familiar with Git-based version control. Furthermore, I am currently learning <strong>React Native</strong> and want to learn about the deployment environment for a hybrid mobile app.",
